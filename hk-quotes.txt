Statement: HK-47 is ready to serve, comrade.
Query: Is there someone that you need killed, comrade?
Explanation: It's just that... you have all these squishy parts, comrade. And all that water! How the constant sloshing doesn't drive you mad, I have no idea...
Retraction: Did I say that out loud? I apologize, comrade. While you are a meatbag, I suppose I should not call you as such.
Definition: Love is making a shot to the knees of a target 120 kilometers away using an Aratech sniper rifle with a tri-light scope.
Observation: I am a cyborg, comrade, with programming. Even if I did not enjoy killing, I would have no choice. Thankfully, I enjoy it very much.
You are a very harsh comrade, comrade. I like you.
Expletive: Damn it, comrade, I am an assassination cyborg... not a dictionary!
Translation: He requires proof of good faith. We must make a contribution to his people that shows we are not a threat. Shall I blast him now, comrade?
Query: Now, are there any other horrors you wish to try and insert into my system, or is your electronic butchery done?
You are like a delightful random cruelty generator, comrade, poisoning all you touch with your presence. You are a testament to all organic meatbags everywhere.
Commentary: As do I. It is our lot in life, I suppose, comrade. Shall we find something to kill to cheer ourselves up?
Answer: Oh, comrade, I could not allow myself to harm another. What if they have families? Or children? We must always think of the children. The littlest ones always suffer in war.
Recitation: Yes, as I said, I am an assassination cyborg. It is my primary function to burn holes through meatbags that you wish removed from the galaxy... Comrade.
Statement: Just a simple cyborg here, ma'am. Nothing to see. Move along.
